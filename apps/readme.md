# Vision Example Applications

The Vision applications are designed to demonstrate basic camera capabilities for 32-bit Microchip microprocessor and microcontroller devices. These applications capture video frames from the camera module interface and either display the captured frames on a display or save them to a USB drive using Microchip development boards.
